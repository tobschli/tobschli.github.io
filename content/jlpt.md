# Current journey

I have signed up to take the JLPT N2 test this December, for which I need a lot of studying to go in every single day.
The most significant habits I have developed for this are:

- Entering new vocabulary (from a vocabulary list)
- Reviewing vocabulary using Anki

## My stats

For these daily habits, I want to share some of my stats here, which I try to keep up-to-date regularly.
Keep in mind, these are just _my_ numbers. I would not call myself a particularly fast learner regarding languages, so bear with me here please.

Every morning I wake up and go to entering new vocab into Anki. I take the next `20` of my list and enter them. 
Some of them I already know, or are just english loan-words, which I skip straight-ahead.
This whole process usually takes `35 - 50` minutes depending on the words complexity and abstractness.

These are the stats of the amount of cards I enter each day, over the last `30` days

And these are the stats of how long I take for reviewing cards every day, over the last `30` days

# My setup

I trust my heart and soul into the effectiveness of Anki.
If you do not know about Anki and are currently studying, be it in school or on your own, I cannot stress enough what a game-changer Anki was for me.
At this point I do not want to go into much detail about what Anki is and how to use it, as there are thousands of better resources out there. (I will add them here soon)

For vocabulary, I tried sticking to the method of the [_Fluent Forever_](https://fluentforeverbook.com/) book.
This means, for every new vocab, I enter:
- Kanji
- Reading
- 2 sample sentences
- 2 images that go along those sentences
- pronounciation in the form of an audio file
